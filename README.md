hi im choke, i (mostly) dabble in
- lua
- javascript & typescript

though i do know these languages as well:
- cpp
- java
- rust
- php

everything i put on my profile is a passion project, so dont expect anything i put out to be updated frequently, though i still check up on my github notifs 

i promise i'll improve this readme 🙏
